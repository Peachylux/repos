        <li>Once it’s finished cooking, transfer the eggs to iced water to stop the cooking. Let them cool completely and peel the eggshells.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the peeled eggs to a bowl and mash with a fork. Try to mash the egg whites into small, same-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Add the sugar and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the freshly ground black pepper and milk. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed.

        <li>Add the mayonnaise and mix very well.
        </li>
        <li>Set out two slices of bread. Spread the butter on both slices of bread. Evenly distribute the egg salad on one slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Put the other slice of bread on top, buttered side down, and place the sandwich between two plates to compress slightly. Set aside for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the crust off the bread</li>
        <li>Cut the sandwich in half. It’s now ready to serve.
